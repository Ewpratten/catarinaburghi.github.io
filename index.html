        For now I have a few ideas, this could become a blog for random things or I could try and go the extra mile and try and make a game. 
     now I have a few things on the list of things I can do (These are answers from the Google form from above): 
    </p>
    <p>
        -Make a simple flash game (whatever you like but I recommend snake)-Personal "about me" style profile-Open an online only restaurant (inspired by Garfield Eats)
        -Make a virtual trading card game-Make an online memorial to Woodie Flowers-Cool stuff-Make it play really scary music in the background
        -Put RSNinja's version of tetris on it-Make an interactive cat (get it?) simulator-idk something cool-You could maybe do some sort of journal or blog, or try and make a game.
        -Make and display a bunch of cool animations and/or simple (but neat) programs-Stuff-Make a virtual piano that gets played when you press the keyboard 'keys' (cuz pianos and laptops both have keys... ha... haha).
        -Make a nice looking and concise (yet still detailed and useful) how to start programming tutorial page-Online Shop (selling soap maybe?)-Show a different picture of a cat (get it?) every time the website is opened.
        -whatever floats your boat-Attach an arduino and a camera to a bear or some animal you find in a forest and constantly live-stream whatever you find to this website-Add analytics
        -Add a daily jokes so you can make people laugh everytime they open your website.-frog.

              I have decided on maybe turning this into a joke website. Where I put (maybe) daily funny jokes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        1st joke: Today at the bank an old lady asked me to check her balance. So I pushed her over.
    </p>
    <p>
        2nd joke: Knock, Knock! Who's there? Hatch. Hatch who? Bless you!
